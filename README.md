# Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website — designed, built, and maintained by me as a continuous work-in-progress.

The site serves as a central hub for:

- My professional background and downloadable resume
- Selected projects and case studies
- Blog posts and personal reflections on technology and digital work
- A list of tools I use and recommend
- Contact and social links (to be added)

### 🌸 Design

The homepage uses a flower-style menu where each petal links to a section of the site. It's a playful and personal touch that reflects both structure and creativity.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- No frameworks — just clean, lightweight code

### 📋 Status

Currently in progress - continuously improving and adding new sections.
