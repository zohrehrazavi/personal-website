              <h2>The Power of "No" in Product Management</h2>
              <p>Learning to say no to good ideas is often more valuable than saying yes to great ones. Every feature request that gets built means something else doesn't. Focus on impact, not just innovation.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="note">
              <h2>User Research ≠ User Feedback</h2>
              <p>User research uncovers needs and behaviors. User feedback often just tells you what users think they want. The former drives strategy, the latter validates solutions. Don't confuse them.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="note">
              <h2>Agile Isn't About Speed</h2>
              <p>Agile methodologies aren't about delivering faster—they're about learning faster. Each sprint should reduce uncertainty, not just produce code. If you're not learning, you're not being agile.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="note">
              <h2>Metrics That Matter</h2>
              <p>Vanity metrics make you feel good. Leading indicators help you predict outcomes. Lagging indicators confirm what happened. Build your dashboard around the middle category.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="note">
              <h2>Stakeholder Management 101</h2>
              <p>Your job isn't to make everyone happy—it's to make the right decisions and bring people along. Transparency about trade-offs builds trust, even when the news isn't what they want to hear.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="note">
              <h2>Technical Debt vs. Product Debt</h2>
              <p>Technical debt slows down developers. Product debt slows down users. Both matter, but product debt is often invisible to engineering teams. Make it visible in your planning.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="note">
              <h2>Documentation as a Competitive Advantage</h2>
              <p>Good documentation doesn't just help your team—it helps your users, your stakeholders, and your future self. Invest in it early, maintain it religiously, and watch productivity soar.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="note">
              <h2>Meeting Effectiveness</h2>
              <p>If you can't articulate what decision needs to be made or what information needs to be shared, don't have the meeting. Send an email instead. Your team will thank you.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="note">
              <h2>Failure as a Learning Tool</h2>
              <p>Projects fail for many reasons, but the biggest failure is not learning from them. Conduct retrospectives, document lessons learned, and create processes that prevent the same mistakes.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="note">
              <h2>Team Velocity vs. Team Health</h2>
              <p>A team can deliver fast while burning out, or slower while building sustainable practices. The second approach wins in the long run. Monitor both metrics and prioritize accordingly.</p>
